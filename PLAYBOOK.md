## COS 460/540 - Computer Networks
# Project 2: HTTP Server

# <<Jonathan Day>>

This project is written in <<Python>> on <<MacOS>>.

## How to compile

You can compile the code and start the server by typing in python3 HttpServer.py. This will start the server with the default port of 8080 and the default root directory of www/. There are also configuarable commandline arguments for example run the server by typing in python3 HttpServer.py -p 8080 -d www/. You can replace 8080 with the port number you want and www/ with the root directory of the file. You do not need to include the back slash after the root directory. I have done my best to make it so minor errors will not break the code.

## How to run

To run the code go into safari or chrome and search localhost:8080 replace 8080 with correct port number. This will bring up the html file with the kitten photos in the root directory. Another way to run this is by typing in localhost:8080/filename.filetype replacing the filename with name of the file and file type with the type of file. This will display the file. Make sure it is abpart of the chosen root directory. Using www/ as the root directory and having all files in that directory is best.

## My experience with this project

This was a very difficult project for me. I spent a good two weeks working on it and it required a lot of research and troubleshooting. The expierence I gained working on the first assignment helped a bit but after I had to research new techniques in order to progress. Mid way through the project I started another group project for another class so I included some different formating as well as block comments as specified in the google coding standards and pep-8. By the end I think I did a good job and everything seems to work well.
